# GSB - Graphical SPARQL Builder

The Graphical SPARQL Builder (short GSB) is a tool which allows the user to create SPARQL Queries in an intuitive way.

Instead of learning SPARQL, the user can rely on a simple GUI to create complex queries and extract data from RDF knowledge bases such as the [DBPedia](http://dbpedia.org/).

The GSB was created by students of Universität Leipzig within the curriculum.

## Project Status

With completion of the internship further development of the GSB ended here.

One of the team members continues the development here https://leipert.github.io/gsb as part of his bachelor thesis.
